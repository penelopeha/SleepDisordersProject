"""-The dataset contains records of 374 people from ages 27 to 59 years old. The average age of respondents is 42 years old.

-Respondents in the dataset sleep on average 7.13 hours with an average quality rating of 7.31 on a rating scale of 1 to 10 in which 1 is bad sleep and 10 is very good sleep.

-On average, respondents do 59 minutes of physical activity and walk 6,816 steps per day.

-The average stress rating of respondents is 5.38 on a rating scale from 1 to 10 in which 1 is low stress and 10 is very high stress.
